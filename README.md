# Artificial Intelligence: Hugging Face
The goal is to demonstrate the tool's navigation and how its resources function.

- Plataform of hosting models de LLM
- Have Datasets
- Have challenges

### Use tools:

- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/

### Showing:

01 - Create Loging and password:
- Need confirm to be is human
- Need create password, accoding to roles
- Need validate your email address isn't fake

2 - After of realize login in, at the home screen:
- Side of screen: ``` New: ```, option:
   * Models: Create your models
   * Datasets: Create your Datasets
   * Space: Create your Space for interact with other users.
   * Collection: Create your Collection
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3463fb48-84e8-4e46-9cbe-408fa5ced6d7)

- In top of screen:
   * Models: collection of the models the others people builded and you can use.
   * Datasets: collection of the datasets the others people builded and you can use.
   * Spaces: like a social network/community.
   * Posts: like a chat room.
   * Docs: documents, How to building Datasets, Models, etc.
   * Enterprise: version for a corporation, there are others services.
   * Pricing: there is a version Free but there are others paid version with advance resources por exemplo.

The click in Models or Datasets, is possible addicional filters to facility search, stay left side:
 - Models: Multimodal, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio, Tabular, Reinforcement Learning and Other.
 - Datasets: Modalities, Size, Format

# Okay, I like of the model and What does I make?

Select the model and check the instructions of the use, how was trained, etc... And It can test on the portal the same screen
